    <h1>b tag</h1>
    <p>To bold the text in HTML, use either the strong tag or the b (bold) tag. Browsers will bold the text inside both of these tags the same, but the strong tag indicates that the text is of particular importance or urgency. You can also bold text with the CSS font-weight property set to “bold.”</p>
    <h1>i tag</h1>
    <p>The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. The <i> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.</p>
    <h1>u tag</h1>
    <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
    <h1>select tag</h1>
    <p>Definition and Usage. The select element is used to create a drop-down list. The select element is most often used in a form, to collect user input. The name attribute is needed to reference the form data after the form is submitted (if you omit the name attribute, no data from the drop-down list will be submitted)</p>
    <h1>button tag</h1>
    <p>The button tag defines a clickable button. Inside a button element you can put text (and tags like i , b , strong, br , img , etc.). That is not possible with a button created with the input element!</p>
